# AI Malpractice Risk Scanner - Pitch

## The Problem

**Medical malpractice is every physician's nightmare.**


 "A foundational study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that nearly all physicians in high-risk specialties, and 75% even in low-risk fields, will be sued at least once in their careers."
   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21848463/

   
- **75%** of doctors face at least one malpractice lawsuit in their career
- Average defense costs: **$50,000** - even when you win
- Years of stress, reputation damage, and emotional toll
- Current solution? Expensive malpractice insurance that only pays AFTER you're sued

**But what if you could prevent the lawsuit before it happens?**

## Our Solution

**AI Malpractice Risk Scanner** - Your AI co-pilot that scans clinical documentation in real-time and warns you: *"This could get you sued."*

Think of it as **spell-check for malpractice risk**.

### How It Works

1. **Paste your clinical note** (or use voice input)
2. **AI analyzes in 30 seconds** using:
   - 50,000+ real malpractice cases
   - Current medical guidelines
   - Legal precedents
3. **Get instant feedback**:
   - Risk score (0-100)
   - Specific vulnerabilities identified
   - Actionable recommendations to protect yourself

### Example

**Input**:
> "55-year-old male with chest pain. Gave aspirin, pain resolved, sent home."

**AI Warning**:
> ⚠️ **HIGH RISK (85/100)**
> - Missing: ECG documentation
> - Missing: Troponin levels
> - Missing: Clear discharge instructions
>
> **Similar Case**: *Johnson v. Memorial Hospital (2019)* - Patient died 2 hours later. $2.3M settlement.
>
> **Protect Yourself Now**:
> 1. Order and document ECG
> 2. Check troponin levels
> 3. Document "explained warning signs, patient verbalized understanding"

## Why Now?

### Market Timing
- **$40B** annual malpractice insurance market
- Physician burnout at all-time high
- EMR systems generate more documentation → more liability exposure
- AI technology finally mature enough for medical applications

### Regulatory Environment
- FDA approving AI diagnostic tools
- Medical boards encouraging "defensive documentation"
- Telemedicine explosion = more documentation, more risk

"Did you run it through the scanner?" becomes standard practice

**Mid-term (3-5 years)**
Integrated into every major EMR system
Malpractice insurance requires usage for best rates
Reduce overall malpractice lawsuits by 20%

**Long-term (5-10 years)**
Expand to nurses, pharmacists, allied health
International markets (UK, Canada, Australia)
Become the Grammarly of healthcare documentation
